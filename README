# Vagrant sample

Provides a starting point for a [https://www.vagrantup.com/](Vagrant) project.

## Provisioning

This skeleton project provides one VM (virtual machine) which is named `server`. There are two scripts provided: `global.sh` and `server.sh`. The VM specific configuration can be placed in `server.sh`. As the project grows, a global configuration can be put in `global.sh`, which will run on all the virtual machines.

## How to use

cd into the root of the project.

```
vagrant up
```

## Outcome 

A Virtual Machine called server, running `ubuntu/xenial64` with 4GB of memory.
